    "## SMOTE \n",
    "\n",
    "SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a popular technique used to address class imbalance in datasets, particularly for classification tasks. The method works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset, rather than just duplicating existing minority class instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How SMOTE Works:**\n",
    "* Select a minority class instance.\n",
    "* Find its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "* Generate synthetic samples by choosing random points along the line segment between the selected instance and its neighbors.\n",
    "* This process helps to create a more balanced training dataset, which can improve the performance of classification models on imbalanced datasets."
